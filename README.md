# Voteban-Discord-Bot

This is the script for a Discord Bot that can act as a voting system to ban people. People with certain ID's can be chosen as someone who can initiate a ban vote. Then, a certain majority of voters must agree on the ban for the ban to go through. If someone is banned, it will be recorded in the ban_record.txt file with their username, ID, and the vote count that got them banned. 

Please read through the file and change relevant variables as requested in "[]".
